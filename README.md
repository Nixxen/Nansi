# Nansi
### Norwegian layout for ANSI keyboards for Microsoft Windows.


My take on the [Norwerty layout by tobiasvl](https://github.com/tobiasvl/norwerty). Base layer is the same as US layout, with Norwegian characters (øæå etc.) on the Alt Gr layer. `¨` on Alt Gr layer is a dead key to write characters like ä and ö.

Clone or download repo and run setup.exe from Nansi folder to install.

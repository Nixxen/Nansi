# Nansi
### Norwegian layout for ANSI keyboards for Microsoft Windows.


My take on the [Norwerty layout by tobiasvl](https://github.com/tobiasvl/norwerty). Base layer is the same as US layout, with Norwegian characters (øæå etc.) on the Alt Gr layer. `¨` on Alt Gr layer is a dead key to write characters like ä and ö.

Clone or download repo and run setup.exe from Nansi folder to install.

Source file for [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134) can be found in the Source folder. Source file has been updated to have VK_SPACE (U+0020) on the spacebar in all shift states. If you want this you have to download Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator and compile it yourself.
